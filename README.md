DailyView is a simple calendar sync, view only application for the Punkt MP02 4G feature phone AphyOS. It synchronises the MP02 to the Apostrophy Services  personal calendar providing a quick view of 4 days (current day and 3 ahead) of scheduled events.  It is developed upon AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater source code and is designed with text-only UI specifically for small screen Android devices with physical keys (no touchscreen). DailyView is available in APK format as an optional installation on the MP02 via OTA from the MP02's App manager. Modified versions of DailyView can be installed on other Android/AOSP devices.
